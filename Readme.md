Installation and Usage

    -src/App.js (this is the main component of your React application. This is where most of your code will go)
    Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files)
    Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
    Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser. Then update the code to your liking.
